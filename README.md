## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry. This project aims to address this issue using machine learning techniques to automatically detect fraudulent transactions. By employing a range of algorithms, the project aims to achieve high accuracy and low false positive rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [provide dataset source and link]. It contains historical credit card transaction data, including features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized features. It's important to note that the dataset is unbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions.

## Installation
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git`
- Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd credit-card-fraud-detection`
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`
